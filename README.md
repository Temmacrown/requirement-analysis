## üìò What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented to guide the development of a software solution. It involves understanding **what the users require** from the system and ensuring those requirements are clearly communicated to all parties involved, including developers, testers, and project managers.

Requirement Analysis helps bridge the gap between business goals and technical implementation. It typically includes both **functional requirements** (what the system should do) and **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform).

### üîç Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Foundation for the Project**: It provides a clear roadmap for the design, development, and testing phases.
- **Reduces Risks and Rework**: Detecting ambiguities and contradictions early reduces costly changes later.
- **Improves Communication**: Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system‚Äôs goals and functionality.
- **Better Project Planning**: Well-defined requirements help in estimating time, cost, and resource needs more accurately.
- **Enhances Product Quality**: Clear requirements lead to effective testing and a system that meets user needs.

### ‚úÖ Activities Involved

- **Requirement Elicitation**: Using interviews, surveys, document analysis, and observation to gather needs.
- **Requirement Analysis and Negotiation**: Interpreting, refining, and prioritizing requirements.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Writing down specifications in formats like SRS (Software Requirements Specification).
- **Requirement Validation**: Checking for completeness, feasibility, and consistency.
- **Requirement Management**: Tracking and updating requirements as the project evolves.

In essence, Requirement Analysis lays the groundwork for successful software development. Skipping or rushing this step often results in scope creep, project delays, or software that doesn‚Äôt meet user expectations.
